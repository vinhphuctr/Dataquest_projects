# Dataquest_projects

Learning with Dataquest, I have had an opportunity to get my hands dirty with the mini projects in the end of each session. Each project carries a different topic (such as marketing, sport, entertainment, management, etc) and is built up using Python and its tools, walking through the data cleaning - analysis - visualisation, the Machine Learning and Deep Learning issues like feature selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, training and testing data.

Of course, those are just relatively simple projects and the way is still long to go... However, I'm happy to see what I have done so far and it motivates me to go ahead !
